This project exists because we needed it ourselves - and we want it to evolve through real feedback. We aim to keep the community welcoming, and contributor-friendly, whether you’re signaling an issue or proposing a larger idea.

If something feels broken, missing, or awkward — **we really want to hear about it**.
Happier grows through shared experience and collaboration.

## What is Happier?

**Happier** is an open-source, end-to-end encrypted companion app for AI coding agents.

It lets you run AI coding sessions **locally on your computer**, then **continue and control them remotely** — from your phone, web UI, or desktop app — without losing context.

Typical use cases include:
- checking long-running refactors while away from your desk,
- approving permissions or responding to agent questions from your phone,
- resuming sessions after restarts,
- collaborating with teammates in the same AI session.

Whether you’re stepping away for a coffee or switching devices mid-task, Happier keeps your AI coding sessions alive and accessible.


## Why “Happier”?

Happier started as a **fork of [Happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy)**.

We were using Happy daily for work and genuinely loved the concept.  
Over time, though, we needed:

- faster iteration,
- stronger reliability,
- better session lifecycle handling,
- and features that weren’t available yet.

So we started building them for ourselves.

After weeks of refining, fixing, and extending the foundation, we decided to share Happier so others could try it, use it, and help shape what comes next.

> Happier is not about replacing Happy.  
> We originally started as contributors to Happy, submitting fixes, improvements, and new features upstream. Over time, we realized that our own needs required faster iteration and a more collaborative model than we could comfortably explore within the main project.
> 
> Happier is about exploring a faster-moving, more collaborative direction — in the open — while remaining deeply grateful for the foundation Happy provided. 


## Key Features

- **Collaborative sessions**  
  Share a live session with teammates or friends (private or public links).

- **Broad provider support**  
  Works with **Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Kilo, Kimi, Qwen, Augment** (and more over time).

- **Multi-server support**  
  Use personal/work/self-hosted servers side-by-side, switch quickly, and keep auth scoped per server.

- **Git-aware file browser + operations**  
  Review changed files and diffs in-session, with optional experimental Git write actions (stage/unstage/commit/pull/push/revert).

- **Persistent sessions**  
  Resume sessions even after restarts; archive them and return later as if they never ended.

- **Seamless switching**  
  Move between terminal, web UI, and mobile while keeping full context.

- **Steering + pending queue controls**  
  Steer compatible sessions while they are running, or queue/edit/reorder messages before processing.

- **Mode/model/permission controls**  
  Pick model and mode per session (provider-capability dependent), and choose explicit permission behavior.

- **Server feature toggles**  
  Server owners can disable selected capabilities (for example social/voice/bug reports) so users only see what is enabled in their environment.

- **Voice options (cloud, BYO, local)**  
  Use Happier Voice, your own ElevenLabs account, or local OpenAI-compatible STT/TTS (including device STT/TTS where available).

- **Smart notification routing**  
  Notification taps open the correct session and server context automatically.

- **In-app bug reports**  
  Submit bug reports from settings, optionally attach diagnostics, and let teams disable report upload flows when required.

- **tmux support**  
  Resume remote-started sessions locally (Claude).


## Security & Privacy

Happier is designed with privacy as a foundation, not an afterthought.

- **End-to-end encryption**  
  Built using modern cryptography (TweetNaCl).

- **Zero-knowledge architecture**  
  Your code is encrypted on your devices before it ever hits the wire.  
  Servers cannot read your data. Encryption keys never leave your devices.

- **Built in Switzerland**  
  Developed in Switzerland, with a strong focus on data protection and developer transparency.


## How It Works

### Step 1: Download App

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happier-claude-codex-opencode/id6758537388"><img width="135" height="39" alt="appstore" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45e31a11-cf6b-40a2-a083-6dc8d1f01291" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.happier.app"><img width="135" height="39" alt="googleplay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acbba639-858f-4c74-85c7-92a4096efbf5" /></a>

### Step 2: Install the CLI on your computer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://happier.dev/install | bash
```

Power-user/npm option (still supported):

```bash
npm install -g @happier-dev/cli
```

### Step 3: Authenticate (recommended: mobile-first)

```bash
happier auth login
```

Recommended first run:
- Choose the mobile path (QR/deep link) so account creation/login and terminal linking happen in one flow.
- If you already use Happier on another device, sign in with that same account.
- If you open the terminal-connect link while logged out, Happier will send you through sign in/create account and then return you to terminal approval.

### Step 4: Start using `happier` instead of `claude`, `codex` or `opencode`

```bash

# Instead of: claude
# Use: happier

happier

# Instead of: codex
# Use: happier codex

happier codex

# Instead of: opencode
# Use: happier opencode

happier opencode

# More providers:
happier gemini
happier kilo
happier kimi
happier qwen

```

### Step 5: Be a Happier developer

Code solo, or invite a friend to jump into the session with you.
Happier acts as a secure bridge between your local development environment and your other devices.

## Running from source

The repo default branch is `dev` and may be unstable. For a more "stable" base, use `preview` or `main`:

```bash
git clone --branch preview https://github.com/happier-dev/happier.git
```

You have then a lot of helper commands available using `yarn run`.

The most important are:

- `yarn auth login` - Authenticate the daemon
- `yarn tui:with-mobile` - Start all the services (UI, server, daemon) in dev mode using an integrated TUI for logs and management
- `yarn happier` - Run the `happier` CLI from the repo
- `yarn daemon` - Control the daemon
- `yarn env` - List & persist env vars that are automatically loaded at startup
- `yarn menubar` - Install and manage the macOS menubar for managing and monitoring Happier
- `yarn mobile:install` - Install and manage a custom mobile app on your phone (**only necessary if you have applied changes to the repo**, otherwise simply use the original Happier app and point it to your server)
- `yarn mobile-dev-client --install` - Install the Expo dev client app on your phone
- `yarn providers` - Install the providers CLIs on your computer (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, etc)
- `yarn self-host` - 
- `yarn remote` - 
- `yarn server` - Start the server in dev mode
- `yarn menubar` - Install and manage the macOS menubar for managing and monitoring Happier
- `yarn logs`, `yarn logs:all`, `yarn logs:daemon`, `yarn logs:expo`, `yarn logs:server`, `yarn logs:services`

## Community-Driven

**Happier** is completely open-source. We built this because we wanted a more powerful, more social way to interact with AI agents - and we want to build it in the open, shaped by the people who actually use it.

This project exists because we needed it ourselves - and we want it to evolve through real feedback. We aim to keep the community welcoming, and contributor-friendly, whether you’re signaling an issue or proposing a larger idea. You are always welcome, whether you’re reporting a small bug or proposing a larger idea.

What that means in practice:
* **Open development** and transparent discussions
* **Fast feedback loops** on issues and pull requests
* A focus on **solving real developer pain**, not chasing hype

If something feels broken, missing, or awkward — we want to hear about it.
Happier grows through shared experience and collaboration.
