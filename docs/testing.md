# Testing

This document records the repository-level test lane map and placement conventions. For workflow details, use the repo skill `skills/happier-testing` and the development guide at `apps/docs/content/docs/development/testing.mdx`.

## Top-level lanes

Canonical lanes:

- `yarn test` — fast unit lane across apps.
- `yarn test:import-cycles` — CLI runtime import-cycle guard, also enforced by the CLI unit lane.
- `yarn test:integration` — orchestration-heavy app integration lane.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:fast` — default local core e2e loop.
- `yarn test:e2e:core:slow` — long orchestration core e2e.
- `yarn test:e2e:ui` — Playwright UI/browser e2e exercising real UI + server + CLI/daemon flows.
- `yarn test:providers` — provider contracts; opt-in/flag-driven.
- `yarn test:db-contract:docker` — server DB contract via Docker.

Use the smallest relevant subset during RED/GREEN loops. Before handoff, run the touched package typecheck/build-enforcing lane and at least one broader relevant lane when shared contracts are touched.

## Lane naming and placement

- App integration tests: `*.integration.test.*`, `*.integration.spec.*`, `*.real.integration.test.*`.
- Core e2e slow tests: `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.slow.e2e.test.ts`.
- Core e2e fast tests: other `packages/tests/suites/core-e2e/**/*.test.ts`.
- UI Playwright e2e: `packages/tests/suites/ui-e2e/**/*.spec.ts`.
- Provider/stress suites remain under `packages/tests/suites/providers` and `packages/tests/suites/stress`.

Treat `test` and `test:unit` as fast lanes. Put Dockerized dependencies, multiprocess setups, external services, real network calls, or other heavy orchestration into integration/e2e/provider lanes.

When introducing or moving a lane/pattern, update all relevant places in the same change:

1. package-level scripts/config,
2. root `package.json` lane scripts,
3. CI workflow wiring.

## UI e2e authoring

- Prefer stable React Native `testID` selectors, queried in Playwright with `getByTestId(...)`.
- Treat e2e `testID`s as API surface; update specs when renaming/removing them.
- Wait for controls to be enabled before clicking.
- Click the real submit/confirm affordance.
- Do not rely on settings-sensitive shortcuts such as Enter-to-send unless the test explicitly configures that setting.
- UI e2e artifacts live under `packages/tests/.project/logs/e2e/ui-playwright/`.
- UI e2e runtime process logs live under `.project/logs/e2e/*ui-e2e*/`.

## Guardrails

- No `.skip`, `.todo`, `.only`, or hidden conditional skips in committed tests unless an explicit opt-in external probe documents the gate.
- No debugging logs in tests.
- No duplicate test intent.
- Evidence must come from trusted runners, not fabricated/manual output.
- Prefer contract-focused assertions over copy/formatting assertions.
