// Shared proof gate for the REACTIVE daemon runtime-auth recovery-success paths.
//
// The daemon-run reactive recovery flow has three success-clear entrypoints:
//   - `onCommittedSwitch`: fires the instant the server active-profile CAS commits
//     (a LOCAL/metadata-only event — NOT provider-outcome proof);
//   - `emitEvent` on `switched`/`observed_generation`: a switch event row;
//   - the `onRuntimeAuthRecoverySuccess` observer: fires on group-switch
//     `switched`/`observed_generation` and on bare `credential_refreshed`.
//
// Before this gate, all three cleared the recovery intent (`markSucceededByKey`)
// with NO provider-outcome proof. That is the exact live loop the plan exists to
// kill: a metadata-only switch / observed_generation / credential refresh treated
// as recovered while the provider session is still broken.
//
// This module routes every reactive entrypoint through the SAME shared,
// provider-agnostic proof contract (`recovery/providerOutcomeProof.ts` via
// `resolveRuntimeAuthRecoveryProof`). A reactive source clears recovery ONLY when
// it carries accepted recovered provider-outcome proof (currently
// account-adoption verified). A genuinely fresh candidate remains useful
// intermediate evidence but does NOT clear recovery by itself. Otherwise the
// recovery stays pending
// (provider-outcome-waiting) under the scheduler's backoff/exhaustion lifecycle.
//
// Each entrypoint maps its own signal onto a switch-result-shaped object (the shape
// `resolveRuntimeAuthRecoveryProof` consumes) so the gate stays single-sourced and
// the entrypoints cannot drift apart.
