// Provider-outcome proof gate for runtime-auth recovery success.
//
// Local recovery substeps (a switch event, an auth-store adoption, a credential
// refresh, a process restart request) are NOT proof that the recovered provider
// can actually authenticate. Treating them as terminal recovery success is the
// root cause behind the live Codex/Pi/Claude recovery loops: recovery was cleared
// while the provider session was still broken.
//
// This helper accepts only DETERMINISTIC evidence at this stage of the work:
//   - account-adoption verified (the switch already runs post-switch account
//     adoption verification and surfaces it as `verificationByServiceId`); or
//   - a genuinely fresh candidate was selected (the adopted profile differs from
//     the exhausted/failed profile).
//
// A bare `credential_refreshed`, a generic `ok: true`, or an `observed_generation`
// with no verification and no candidate change is INTERMEDIATE: the local step
// completed, but no provider-outcome proof exists yet. We must not clear the
// recovery as recovered in that case; the existing scheduler lifecycle keeps it
// pending/waiting (and ultimately moves it toward action-required/exhausted),
// instead of fabricating a stuck "succeeded" state.
//
// WAVE-3 SEAM: bounded provider-activity proof (assistant delta / tool call /
// accepted in-flight steer after the recovery boundary, with a timeout -> terminal)
// is the second proof class. It is modeled in the shared
// `recovery/providerOutcomeProof.ts` contract as `provider_activity` but is
// intentionally NOT produced here so we do not create "wait forever" states;
// until it lands, refresh-without-deterministic-proof simply stays pending under
// the scheduler's normal backoff/exhaustion lifecycle.
//
// This resolver MAPS the runtime-auth switch result onto the shared, provider-agnostic
// `ProviderOutcomeProofKind` contract. The mapping is thin and behavior-preserving:
// the deterministic evidence it can establish is `account_adoption_verified` and
// `fresh_candidate_selected`. Only account-adoption is a recovered proof today;
// fresh-candidate selection intentionally stays intermediate until later provider
// activity/native resume/quota proof arrives. All other local completions
// (credential_refreshed, generic ok:true, unverified switch/observed_generation)
// map to `null` (no proof).
