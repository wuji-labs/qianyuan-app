// Shared, provider-agnostic provider-outcome proof contract.
//
// THE SUCCESS BOUNDARY IS THE ROOT CAUSE. Across Codex, Pi, and Claude the live
// recovery loops all came from the same mistake: a LOCAL recovery substep (a
// switch event, an auth-store adoption, a credential refresh, an observed
// generation bump, a process restart, a continuation-prompt enqueue) was treated
// as proof the provider had actually recovered. It is not. Recovery is "done"
// only when the PROVIDER OUTCOME is proven, or when the system reaches a durable,
// user-visible terminal state.
//
// This module is the single source of truth for "what counts as proof". It is
// intentionally PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC: it contains no provider-name branching. Each
// provider/scheduler maps its own domain-specific result onto one of these
// evidence classes in its OWN owner module (backends/<provider>/**,
// runtimeAuth/**, usageLimitRecovery/**), then asks this module whether the
// evidence is proof. Provider specifics never leak in here.
//
// Wave-1 lanes intentionally kept this logic local to avoid parallel-edit
// collisions. This module is the wave-2 consolidation of those local guards
// (Lane A runtime-auth, Lane B usage-limit/Codex). Lane C (Pi compaction turn
// outcome) deliberately uses a DISTINCT vocabulary (turn settlement, not recovery
// proof) and is not folded in here; its `completed_post_final` outcome is a
// turn-lifecycle decision, not a provider-outcome proof.

/**
 * The proof classes the recovery system accepts as evidence that a recovery path
 * may transition out of "still recovering". These mirror the plan's
 * "Provider Outcome Evidence" section exactly.
 *
 * Positive (recovery may complete / terminate visibly):
 * - `provider_activity`: meaningful provider output, tool call, assistant delta,
 *   or accepted in-flight steer AFTER the recovery boundary and matching the
 *   recovery identity. The continuation controller owns the bounded wait and
 *   timeout state; schedulers consume the proof through this shared vocabulary.
 * - `native_resume`: provider-specific evidence that the recovered provider
 *   accepted vendor/session resume state.
 *   RESERVED (RD-REC-14): no producer exists yet. Provider leaves must pass it
 *   through the explicit `proofKind` pass-through seam on switch/recovery results
 *   (see `resolveRuntimeAuthRecoveryProof`) when the P7 capability-descriptor work
 *   lands (e.g. Codex `thread/resume` acceptance). The host must NOT fabricate it
 *   from local spawn success — that is exactly the local-substep mistake this
 *   contract exists to kill.
 * - `quota_probe_fresh`: a provider quota probe proves the selected profile is
 *   not exhausted for the same service/fingerprint.
 *   The quotas coordinator / provider quota fetchers own this evidence. It is
 *   produced only from normalized, fresh quota snapshots after service/profile,
 *   group-generation, and, when independently available, material-fingerprint
 *   checks. It is not account adoption proof and must not be upgraded into exact
 *   runtime-account identity.
 * - `fresh_candidate_selected`: the adopted connected-service profile/account is
 *   genuinely DIFFERENT from the exhausted/failed one (and not known-exhausted
 *   for the same fingerprint). This is useful evidence, but it is still
 *   INTERMEDIATE: the provider has not yet accepted work under the new account.
 * - `account_adoption_verified`: a post-switch verification accepted the new auth surface.
 *   `verified` may carry exact account proof; `weakly_verified` is provenance/auth-surface
 *   proof only and must not be treated as exact runtime-account identity.
 * - `terminal_action_required`: no automatic path is valid; a visible user action
 *   state is emitted.
 * - `terminal_exhausted`: retry/dead-letter budget reached and visible.
