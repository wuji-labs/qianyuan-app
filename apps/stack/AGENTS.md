## Big picture (what lives where)

### This package (`@happier-dev/stack`)

- `scripts/*.mjs`: orchestration CLIs (setup/bootstrap, run/dev/build, stacks, worktrees, service, tailscale, mobile, tools).

### Your local installation (defaults)

- Home: `~/.happier-stack`
- Workspace: `~/.happier-stack/workspace`
- Default repo checkout: `<workspace>/main`
- Dev checkout (worktree): `<workspace>/dev`
- Worktree categories: `<workspace>/{pr,local,tmp}/...`
- Stack storage: `~/.happier/stacks/<stack>/...` (stack env file: `~/.happier/stacks/<stack>/env`)

### Happier monorepo

- `apps/ui` (UI)
- `apps/cli` (CLI + daemon)
- `apps/server` (server; light/full flavors)

## Non-negotiables (agents)

### Command discipline (only use `hstack ...`)

Use hstack for everything:

- `hstack start` / `hstack dev`
- `hstack typecheck` / `hstack lint` / `hstack test` / `hstack build`
- `hstack stack ...` (isolated stacks)
- `hstack wt ...` (repo worktrees)
- `hstack tailscale ...` / `hstack service ...`
- `hstack tools ...` (setup-pr/review-pr/import/review/edison)

Do not run these directly in the monorepo:

- `yarn dev`, `yarn start`, `expo ...`, `tsc`, `eslint`, `docker compose ...`
- raw `git worktree ...` (use `hstack wt ...`)

If you’re tempted to run a low-level command, route it through `hstack` (or add a `hstack` subcommand).

### You must develop in worktrees only

- Do **not** develop directly in the default checkout (typically `<workspace>/main`).
  - Treat it as **read-only** “launcher defaults”.
- All changes should happen inside:
  - `<workspace>/dev` (first-class dev worktree)
  - `<workspace>/pr/<...>` (PR worktrees)
  - `<workspace>/local/<owner>/<...>` (local worktrees; owner is your local username)
  - `<workspace>/tmp/<owner>/<...>` (throwaway worktrees)

### You must test changes inside isolated stacks

- When testing a feature/PR, create an isolated stack and point it at your worktree:
  - `hstack stack new exp1 --interactive`
  - `hstack stack wt exp1 -- use <owner/branch|/abs/path>`
- Avoid editing `env.local` by hand; prefer stack env files and `hstack stack env ...`.

## Worktrees (monorepo-only)

### Layout

The workspace contains:

- `main/` (stable checkout; treat as read-only)
- `dev/` (first-class dev worktree)
- categorized worktrees:
  - `pr/<...>`
  - `local/<owner>/<...>`
  - `tmp/<owner>/<...>`

Examples:

- `<workspace>/pr/123-fix-thing`
- `<workspace>/local/<you>/my-patch`

### Common commands

- Create: `hstack wt new pr/my-feature --from=upstream --use`
- PR checkout: `hstack wt pr 123 --use`
- Switch active checkout: `hstack wt use pr/123-fix-thing`
- List/status: `hstack wt list` / `hstack wt status`

### Targeting a worktree without mutating a stack

Pass a one-shot override:

- `hstack stack typecheck <stack> --repo=dev`
- `hstack stack build <stack> --repo=pr/123-fix-thing`
- `hstack stack build <stack> --repo=/abs/path/to/monorepo`

---

## Main stack safety

The default stack (`main`) is meant to stay stable.

By default, `hstack wt use` refuses to repoint `main` to an arbitrary worktree/path. Recommended flow:

- Create a new stack and switch that stack:
  - `hstack stack new exp1 --interactive`
  - `hstack stack wt exp1 -- use pr/123-fix-thing`

Override (only if you really mean it):

- `hstack wt use pr/123-fix-thing --force`

---

## Safety invariants (must not regress)

These are intentional safety properties. Preserve them unless explicitly redesigning them.

### Process isolation (stacks)

- Never kill by port in stack mode.
- Stack stop/restart must kill only stack-owned processes (PIDs recorded in `stack.runtime.json` / stack markers).

### Ephemeral ports (non-main stacks)

- Non-main stacks pick ports at start time; ports are recorded in `stack.runtime.json`.
- `--restart` must reuse previous runtime ports or fail closed if occupied.

### Watch mode

- Watcher restarts must be stack-owned (PID verified). Unknown PIDs must not be restarted.

### Tailscale Serve

- Do not auto-enable/repoint Tailscale Serve for non-main stacks by default.

### Daemons

- Multiple daemons are expected (one per stack).
- Never “fix” issues by killing all daemons.

---

## Auth + secrets

- Configure a seed stack once (recommended: `dev-auth`).
- New stacks can reuse auth without re-login:
  - `hstack stack auth <name> copy-from dev-auth`

Environment knobs:

- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTH_SEED_FROM=<seed>`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTO_AUTH_SEED=1`

---

## Commit messages (Conventional Commits)

Use Conventional Commits for all commits (and for squash messages):

```text
<type>[optional scope][!]: <description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `revert`

---

## Stack testing rules

- Keep stack on native `node --test`. Do not migrate stack tests to Vitest or Playwright conventions.
- Canonical stack runner/discovery helpers live under `scripts/utils/test/**`.
- Canonical stack-local testkit primitives live under `scripts/testkit/core/**`.
- Prefer reusing those helpers over adding new ad hoc tempdir/env/spawn wrappers in test files or domain testkits.
- Unit tests use `*.test.mjs`.
- Integration tests use `*.integration.test.mjs` and remain serial.
- Real integration tests use `*.real.integration.test.mjs`, remain serial, and must stay opt-in behind `HAPPIER_STACK_RUN_REAL_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`.
- Exclude vendored/generated artifacts from stack test discovery and migration inventories.
- Use the package lanes when validating stack test infrastructure:
  - `yarn --cwd apps/stack test:unit`
  - `yarn --cwd apps/stack test:integration`
  - If `yarn` is not on PATH in the current environment, use `corepack yarn ...`.
