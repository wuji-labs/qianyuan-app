/**
 * Seed `release-notes-last-seen-release-id` for users who already saw the legacy
 * numeric changelog at install/upgrade time, so we do not retroactively show them
 * release-notes story cards they have already implicitly acknowledged.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - Run at most once per release id baseline (idempotent).
 *  - If the user already has a release-notes seen marker, do nothing.
 *  - Legacy users who already viewed changelog updates get the current curated
 *    release marked as seen so release notes do not appear retroactively.
 *  - Fresh installs only record the migration baseline, preserving the first
 *    curated story intended for the installed app version.
