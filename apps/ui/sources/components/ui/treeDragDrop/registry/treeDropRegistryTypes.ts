 * Tree drag/drop geometry registry contracts.

 * Phase 0.5 interface freeze (`session-list-drag-geometry-performance-unification.md`,
 * sections 3.1, 3.2). This file distinguishes window-coordinate types (the
 * platform-measurement boundary) from content-coordinate types (the live
 * geometry registry storage). New code MUST use the content-coordinate types;
 * the window types remain only for `measureWindowBounds` measurement results.
 *
 * Ownership decision (recorded for lanes A-D):
 * - `useTreeDropRegistry` is the canonical live content-coordinate geometry
 *   registry. There is no second registry, no absolute-window snapshot type,
 *   and no scroll-rebasing api.
 * - The registry is queried LIVE at resolve time and is NEVER frozen into a
 *   drag snapshot. Rows register progressively as they mount (at drag start
 *   AND while autoscrolling previously-offscreen targets).
