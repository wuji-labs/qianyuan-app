/**
 * The single, canonical way to seed a live TipTap `Editor` from a markdown
 * string for the rich markdown editor.
 *
 * Why this exists: the risky-markdown pre-pass (`encodeRiskyMarkdown`) MUST run
 * at EVERY parse/seed boundary, or raw HTML / HTML comments on the un-encoded
 * path silently fail to round-trip (the encode/decode asymmetry that is the #1
 * correctness risk for this feature). Multiple surfaces seed editors via
 * `setContent(..., { contentType: 'markdown' })`:
 *  - the headless WebView bundle entry (`bridge/tiptapWebViewEntry.ts`) on
 *    `init` and `setDoc`,
 *  - (the web surface seeds via `markdownToDoc`, which encodes internally).
 *
 * Routing those `setContent` calls through this one helper means the encode can
 * never be forgotten on one platform: there is exactly one place that turns a
 * markdown string into editor content via `setContent`, and it always encodes
 * first. (The doc-/round-trip parse path goes through `markdownToDoc`, which
 * encodes internally; this helper is the live-editor `setContent` analogue.)
 *
 * Serialize is UNAFFECTED: the raw-HTML atom nodes re-emit the decoded bytes
 * verbatim, so `editor.getMarkdown()` already returns the original markdown — it
 * must NOT be re-encoded.
 *
 * R18: imports `@tiptap/*`, so it lives in `core/tiptap/`.
