/**
 * FR4-7: home-aware favorite directory toggle.
 *
 * The `favoriteDirectories` setting can store paths in either form:
 *   - Absolute: `/Users/alice/src/app`
 *   - Home-relative shorthand (portable across machines): `~/src/app`
 *
 * Toggle requests, however, always arrive with the absolute path the user
 * clicked (e.g. from the path picker rows). The previous implementation
 * compared the stored entry to the click target by raw string equality, so a
 * stored `~/src/app` entry could never be removed by pressing the filled-star
 * on its `/Users/alice/src/app` row — the filter never matched, and the
 * absolute path was appended as a duplicate.
 *
 * This helper normalizes BOTH sides via `resolveAbsolutePath` before comparing:
 *   - Remove: every stored entry whose resolved absolute matches the target's
 *     resolved absolute is removed (so duplicate home-relative + absolute
 *     entries are deduped in a single press).
 *   - Add: when the target is not yet a favorite, it is appended in its
 *     original (caller-supplied) form so callers that pass shorthand keep
 *     portability across machines.
 *
 * The helper is intentionally pure so it can be exercised in unit tests
 * without React or storage plumbing.
