# Changelog

## Version 0.2.6 - 2026-05-14

This update improves session folder organization reliability.

- Fixed session and folder drag-and-drop so nested items can move back to the workspace root, folder drops cleanly reset after blocked moves, and drag targets remain accurate while scrolling.

## Version 0.2.1 - 2026-04-05

This is a massive release. Here's everything that changed.

## Bug Fixes

A large number of reported bugs have been fixed in this release:

- **First prompt consumed / session stuck waiting for input**
- **Default server URL in the app** — self-hosted web deployments now auto-seed the correct same-origin server profile on first load
- **Server URL and public URL handling** — loopback/localhost server URLs are now properly excluded from QR codes, share links, and canonical URL adoption to prevent mobile devices from resolving unreachable addresses
- **iOS path picker** — fixed file and directory selection on iOS
- **`change_title` tool** — now properly wired and required before first reply, fixing broken session title behavior
- **OpenCode plan/build modes** — plan and build mode flags are now correctly passed through to the OpenCode backend
- **`/clear` command** — now properly wired and propagated to Claude, Codex, and OpenCode backends
- **"Working" session indicator flicker** — resolved timing issue causing the indicator to flash unexpectedly
- **Session list flicker** — fixed session list rerender churn during streaming updates
- **Push notifications** — delivery and routing issues resolved; per-device server URL routing is now correct
- **Permission request display** — permissions are now shown more clearly and consistently across all surfaces
- **Separation of user actions and permissions** — `AskUserQuestion`, `ExitPlanMode`, and similar agent-driven requests are now displayed separately from tool permission requests in the inbox and transcript
- **Horizontal scrolling in markdown tables and code blocks** — fixed clipping and overflow behavior across platforms, including a specific Android crash where large tables would expand beyond bounds
- **Back button unresponsive** — resolved navigation deadlock on certain route transitions
- **Claude MCP and user settings preservation** — MCP configuration and account settings are no longer dropped on session restart or environment reloads
- **Mermaid WebView HTML injection** — security fix preventing malicious Mermaid diagrams from injecting HTML
- **Nested Claude Code environment leaks** — `CLAUDE_*` environment variables are now stripped before spawning child processes to prevent recursion/conflicts
- **Out-of-order message batches** — incoming socket message batches are now sorted before being applied to the reducer
- **Session prompt dropping** — fixed a regression where user prompts could be silently dropped under certain conditions
- **Codex speed mode eligibility** — speed option is now correctly restricted to eligible accounts and models
- **Cold-start machine list blank-state flicker / list pops in and shifts on app resume** — the machines list no longer drops to empty while machine encryption is still initializing, and cached machines are returned immediately even when the bootstrap isDataReady flag hasn't settled yet, eliminating the layout jump when returning to the app from the background
- **Claude compaction hang: long threads triggered compaction but queued messages stalled until stop** — the turn is now correctly finalized on system/init compaction events for both the remote Agent SDK and the SDK backend, keeping the prompt pump moving and draining pending sends without requiring a manual stop
- **Pending queue messages sent out of order** — when multiple messages were queued quickly, larger or later messages could appear to send first; fixed at three layers: the server now reserves positions with an atomic per-session counter so legacy sessions can't append into the middle of the queue, the UI preserves optimistic insertion order without re-sorting by createdAt, and enqueue call order is now serialized per session so earlier encryption resolving late can't swap two queued messages
- **`happier session send` only worked for active sessions** — happier session send <id> <message> now correctly queues messages for inactive sessions via socket-commit, consistent with how the mobile app behaves
- **`bun install -g @happier-dev/cli@next` fails with 404 errors** — Bun doesn't honor `bundledDependencies` and was fetching unpublished internal `@happier-dev/*` packages from the registry; the packed tarball now strips those entries from `package.json` while keeping the bundled files intact
- **`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `@happier-dev/release-runtime` after npm install** — bundled workspace packages were missing from the published CLI tarball; bundled workspace sync is now part of the release packaging step
- **CLI binary crashes with `Illegal instruction` on older x86-64 CPUs** — Linux x64 release binaries now use `bun-linux-x64-baseline` (pre-AVX2 compatible) instead of the default modern build
- **`hstack stack auth` hangs forever when the daemon is crash-looping** — guided stack auth now times out on an unhealthy web UI path and falls back to mobile auth instead of waiting indefinitely
- **`hstack happier` overrides the CLI server URL and breaks cloud auth** — the stack wrapper no longer shadows an already-configured CLI server setting, so multi-terminal workflows on the same machine work correctly
- **Daemon loses machine registration on transient DNS failures at startup** — the daemon now retries registration in a background loop with a configurable policy; `EAI_AGAIN`, timeouts, and connection errors recover automatically without a manual restart
- **`happier --resume <happier-session-id>` passes the ID straight to the provider CLI, which rejects it** — Happier session IDs are now detected and resolved to their vendor resume ID before dispatching to the provider
- **Session working directory missing from `happier daemon list` output** — the `/list` endpoint now includes an optional `directory` field per session
- **`session.continueWithReplay` not accessible from the daemon HTTP API** — `POST /continue-with-replay` is now exposed on the daemon control server, backed by the same shared implementation used by the machine RPC handler
- **Mobile UI locks up and can't change server URL when the server is unreachable** — the reachability probe now uses the endpoint supervision path, which is timeout-safe and cancellable, instead of a raw fetch that could hang indefinitely
- **Enhanced Session Wizard crashes on new session creation** (`undefined is not an object: 'acpSessionModeOptions'`) — null-guarded in the wizard preflight
- **OpenCode sessions showed no model choices in the picker** — the model picker now shows probed/available models instead of an empty list
- **Can't log in from another terminal after the first login** — `hstack happier` no longer overwrites an explicitly configured server URL from CLI settings when a stack environment is present
- **Sessions frequently lock up and appear stuck `in_progress`** — ACP tools in a permission-pending state were incorrectly arming execution timeouts; timeouts are now only started after the permission gate clears. OpenCode/Kilo backends were also stalling on `allow_once` replies; they now prefer `allow_always` when approving to avoid a vendor-side hang
- **Web markdown tables clipped with no visible scroll** — the table `ScrollView` was hiding the horizontal scroll indicator and forcing `overflow: hidden` on web; both are now corrected
- **Stale permission approval cards remained visible in inactive sessions** — when a session goes inactive, pending tool calls now always render as canceled/failed instead of leaving un-actionable approval buttons. Voice context surfaces were hardened to match
- **Unresponsive taps on tool expand icons and back button on mobile** — a hidden Drawer layer was still mounted on narrow viewports and intercepting touch events; the shell now renders a plain Stack on mobile widths. Validated with live iOS Safari QA

### OpenCode

- **OpenCode Server as the default backend** — managed server orchestration handles startup, health checks, and shutdown
- **Local/remote switching** — start a session with `happier opencode` in the terminal, use the OpenCode TUI experience directly in your terminal, and open the session in Happier's UI to follow or control it

- Follow a session currently running outside Happier (e.g. started with `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode` in the terminal) — messages stream into Happier in real time
- Take over / import a session — Happier links to it, stores the transcript, and you can continue from the app

### Direct Sessions

- New "direct" session mode where Happier does not persist the session transcript server-side — messages are forwarded directly between machine and connected devices
- Direct session linking and takeover with full transcript import

### Session Forking and Replay

- Fork any Happier session
- **"Fork from message"** — forks happen at the correct point in the conversation, not at the latest message
- **Happier Fork** — for backends that don't support native forking, Happier Replay extracts session messages and replays them into a new session up to the chosen fork point
- **Replay seed sizing limits** — prevents oversized prompts from causing failures

### Nightly Dev Releases

Due to popular demand, a new release lane builds nightly from the `dev` branch and publishes new dev releases for the app, CLI, Docker images, relay server, and more.

Dev should **not** be treated as stable — it can break at any time and may contain partial commits or breaking changes.

The recommended way to run Happier is using the preview releases, which will now have a much more frequent release cycle.
