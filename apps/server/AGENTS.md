# Happier Server Instructions

This file is the package-specific instruction file for `apps/server`.

Read the root `AGENTS.md` first. Package rules here override root rules only where they are more specific.

## Commands

Use yarn.

- `yarn build` — build/type-enforcing lane.
- `yarn start` — start the server.
- `yarn test` — run server tests.
- `yarn migrate` — run existing Prisma migrations when intentionally requested.
- `yarn generate` — generate Prisma client/types when needed.
- `yarn db` — start local PostgreSQL in Docker.

## Core stack

- TypeScript strict mode.
- Fastify for HTTP routes.
- Prisma/PostgreSQL for storage.
- Zod for request/response validation.
- Socket.IO/Redis for realtime/event infrastructure.
- Yarn for package management.

## Source layout

- `sources/app/**` — application entrypoints and route/action ownership.
- `sources/modules/**` — reusable modules that abstract related complexity.
- `sources/storage/**` — database/storage helpers, transaction wrappers, Prisma client access.
- `sources/utils/**` — low-level utilities.
- `sources/recipes/**` — scripts run outside the server runtime.

Prefer existing domain folders and module owners before creating new top-level folders.

## TypeScript and style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in server code.
- Use strict TypeScript and accurate exported types.
- Prefer functional/declarative patterns; avoid classes unless they clearly improve ownership.
- Prefer interfaces over broad object aliases when modeling stable contracts.
- Avoid enums for new code; prefer typed maps/unions where consistent with the package.
- Use absolute imports with the package alias when available.
- Utility files should have explicit, purpose-revealing names, preferably matching their primary export.

## Database and transactions

- Do not create Prisma migrations yourself. Humans own migration creation.
- Do not change Prisma schema unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Use `inTx` for database operations that must be transactional.
- Use `afterTx` for events/side effects that must run only after a successful commit.
- Do not run non-transactional side effects (file uploads, external calls, notifications, etc.) inside DB transactions.
- For complex DB fields, use JSON deliberately and validate at the application boundary.

## API and actions

- Routes live under the server application route owners; use Fastify and Zod for type-safe route definitions.
- Always validate external input with Zod or the canonical schema for that boundary.
- Design retryable operations to be idempotent. Clients may retry automatically, and repeated calls should produce the same durable result as one call.
- When writing DB-backed action functions, put each action in a dedicated file in the relevant app/domain subfolder. Prefer `entityAction` naming, for example `friendAdd`.
- Do not return data from action functions “just in case”; return only the essential contract.
- After writing an action, add/keep a documentation comment that explains the action logic and update it when logic changes.

## Privacy and encoding

- Never log secrets, tokens, encrypted secret plaintext, private keys, or raw credential payloads.
- Do not add logging unless it is necessary for the task or follows an existing diagnostics pattern.
- Use `privacyKit.decodeBase64` and `privacyKit.encodeBase64` from privacy-kit instead of Buffer-based one-off base64 logic.
- Prefer GitHub usernames for GitHub identity/user-facing GitHub references.

## Feature gates

- Do not gate route behavior with ad-hoc env checks when the feature is represented by the canonical feature system.
- `/v1/features` assembly is centralized; route handlers should use server feature gate helpers.
- Missing or malformed feature bits fail closed.

## Testing

- Use Vitest and existing server route/DB harnesses.
- Prefer real database/storage behavior with test isolation over internal mocks.
- Test files should use the package's established suffix and location conventions.
- For utility functions and behavior changes, write/update tests before implementation.
- If a storage/API contract changes, update affected route/DB tests in the same change.

## Debugging

Use `skills/happier-diagnose` for Happier issue diagnosis and evidence collection. Server logs are under `.logs/` when enabled, and consolidated client/server debugging can use `DANGEROUSLY_LOG_TO_SERVER_FOR_AI_AUTO_DEBUGGING=true` only when intentionally diagnosing.
