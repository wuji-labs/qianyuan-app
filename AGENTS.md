# Agent Constitution

This file is the canonical cross-tool constitution for this repository. Re-read it at the start of each task and after context compaction. Also read the nearest package `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` for package-specific rules.

## Read order

1. Root `AGENTS.md` (this file).
2. Nearest package instructions:
   - UI: `apps/ui/AGENTS.md`
   - CLI: `apps/cli/AGENTS.md`
   - Server: `apps/server/AGENTS.md`
   - Stack: `apps/stack/AGENTS.md`
3. Task-specific skills when relevant, especially:
   - `skills/happier-testing` for repo-specific testing and lane selection.
   - `skills/happier-diagnose` for Happier daemon/session/provider/auth issues.
   - `test-driven-development` before behavior-changing implementation.
   - `context7-mcp` before using post-training library/package knowledge.
   - `agent-browser` / `agent-device` / Argent skills for browser or device QA.
   - `autoreview` for closeout review after non-trivial edits.

## Core operating policy

- **Follow through:** if the user's intent is clear and the next step is reversible and low-risk, proceed without asking.
- Ask permission only when a step is irreversible, has external side effects, requires sensitive information, or requires a material product/design choice.
- Treat the task as incomplete until all requested items are handled or explicitly marked `[blocked]` with the missing data.
- For multi-item work, keep an internal checklist and verify coverage before finalizing.
- Persist to an implemented, verified, clearly reported outcome whenever feasible.
- Prefer parallel tool calls for independent retrieval/lookup steps; do not parallelize dependent or speculative work.
- Protect context: load the minimum relevant snippets, avoid dumping logs/build artifacts, and summarize large artifacts by path.

## Evidence-first work

Base fixes and refactors on observed facts, not assumptions.

- Inspect current code, call sites, tests, logs, schemas, and runtime behavior before changing code.
- For bugs, reproduce or identify the failing path before fixing whenever feasible.
- Distinguish observed facts, hypotheses, and decisions in reasoning and final reports.
- Do not infer behavior solely from file names, comments, or stale docs; verify against implementation or tests.
- Prefer instrumentation or focused tests over speculative fixes when the cause is unclear.
- If evidence is missing, say what is missing and what would verify it.
- Do not claim a test, typecheck, build, or manual QA passed unless it actually ran.
- If blocked, name the blocker and the next concrete action.

## Execution loop

Use this loop for implementation work:

1. Understand current behavior.
2. Find the existing owner/pattern.
3. Write or adjust the smallest meaningful test when behavior changes.
4. Make the smallest coherent change.
5. Run the narrowest relevant check.
6. Broaden validation before handoff.
7. Self-review the diff for scope, correctness, and evidence.

## Multi-agent safety

This repo is often edited by multiple agents at once.

- Never remove, revert, overwrite, or “clean up” unrelated changes just because they are unexpected.
- Before touching a file, assume uncommitted changes may belong to another in-flight agent unless proven otherwise.
- If a change appears accidental but is unrelated to your task, ask before altering it.
- Do not create ad-hoc summary/report/status files. Use the final response or approved project locations only.

## Git safety (non-negotiable)

- Never switch branches in the primary checkout.
- Do not create/delete branches unless explicitly requested.
- Never run or emulate destructive git cleanup without explicit approval, including:
  - `git reset`
  - `git restore`
  - `git clean`
  - `git checkout`
  - `git switch`
  - any command whose purpose is to discard local work
- Use read-only git commands for inspection (`status`, `diff`, `log --no-pager`) unless the user asked for a mutation.

## Testing and TDD

### Behavior-change rule

- Any production behavior change requires TDD: write/update a relevant failing test first, verify RED, implement minimal GREEN, refactor with tests green.
- Do a test inventory before adding tests: search existing coverage by symbol/module, route/command, config key, feature id, component, error code, and package-local harnesses.
- Prefer updating or consolidating existing tests over adding overlapping tests.
- If implementation already exists before a test, stop and restore test-first order where feasible; otherwise explicitly report the exception and rationale.

### What does not need new tests

- Content-only Markdown/template/copy changes that do not affect executable runtime behavior.
- CSS/styling-only changes unless they alter interaction, accessibility, or visibility semantics.
- Mechanical renames/moves/formatting with no runtime effect, though relevant existing checks should still run.

### Test quality rules

- No content-policing tests that primarily pin wording, Markdown formatting, whitespace, or example config values.
- Assert observable behavior and stable contracts, not incidental implementation details or exact user-facing prose.
- Test error type/code/shape/status rather than full message wording unless the message is a published contract.
- Keep positive fixtures aligned with the real runtime contract when capabilities, feature flags, session state, or availability become required.
- Reset shared state in tests using dynamic imports, module caches, mutable globals, or reused mocks.

### No internal mocks

- Test real internal behavior. Do not mock domain logic, reducers/selectors, parsers, normalization, permission/state machines, store logic, or orchestration helpers.
- Boundary mocks are allowed for system boundaries only: third-party APIs, payment/email providers, platform/native SDKs, OS/process/time/random/env adapters.
- If a boundary mock is used, document why and assert outcomes/state, not only call counts.
- Use canonical package testkits/helpers before creating new mocks or fixtures.
- UI tests should prefer `apps/ui/sources/dev/testkit/**` and imports from `@/dev/testkit` for common boundaries (`expo-router`, `@/text`, `@/modal`, `react-native`, `react-native-unistyles`, storage).

### Validation lanes

- For tight RED/GREEN loops, run the smallest relevant test slice.
- Before handoff, run the touched package typecheck/build lane and the relevant broader test lane.
- Canonical repo lanes are documented in `docs/testing.md` and `apps/docs/content/docs/development/testing.mdx`.
- TypeScript changes require the relevant package typecheck/build-enforcing lane before handoff.

## Type safety and code hygiene

- TypeScript must remain strict. Do not weaken `tsconfig` or type rules to make tests/builds pass.
- `@ts-ignore` is forbidden.
- `@ts-expect-error` is allowed only with a short rationale and only on the exact expected-failure line.
- Broad `as any` casts are forbidden except in narrow boundary fixtures/harnesses with a one-line justification.
- Prefer `satisfies`, explicit interfaces, typed fixtures, and canonical schemas over casting.
- No TODO/FIXME placeholders in production code.
- No stray `console.log` or debug statements.
- Remove dead code and commented-out code blocks.

## Engineering taste

- Optimize for readability over cleverness.
- Prefer one obvious path over multiple parallel mechanisms.
- Do not invent abstractions until repeated real use justifies them.
- Make illegal states unrepresentable where practical.
- Delete obsolete code when your change makes it obsolete.
- “Simple” means lower long-term system complexity, not necessarily fewer changed lines.
- Keep changes coherent and reviewable; avoid unrelated drive-by edits.
- If a refactor is necessary to solve the problem well, do it as part of the same coherent change and explain why.
- If you notice a valuable but unrelated refactor, mention it or ask before doing it.

## Implementation quality

- Read first: inspect existing owners, helpers, harnesses, builders, and patterns before implementing.
- Reuse or extend canonical implementations instead of adding similar-but-different logic.
- Keep code with its natural owner: shared primitives in shared packages, package-specific logic in the owning package.
- Prefer focused modules and cohesive folders over god files or grab-bag folders.

## Files, folders, and ownership

Prefer small, focused files organized under coherent domain folders.

- Avoid god files. If a file mixes responsibilities or becomes hard to scan, split it into domain-owned pieces.
- Prefer a folder with several focused files over one large file with unrelated sections.
- Reuse the nearest existing domain folder before creating a new top-level folder.
- Keep related behavior together under the same domain owner; do not scatter one feature across unrelated areas.
- When a folder accumulates too many files to scan comfortably, introduce meaningful subfolders and regroup related files by domain/behavior.
- Use folder context to keep filenames short. Do not encode the whole path into the filename.
  - Prefer `agents/providers/claude/install.ts`.
  - Avoid `agents/providers/claude/claudeProviderInstallationManager.ts`.
- Do not create parent folders solely to shorten filenames or satisfy a mechanical split. A nested folder must represent a real domain/subdomain with a coherent owner.
- Compound folder names are acceptable when the compound term is the domain concept. Do not split `terminalHost` into `terminal/host` unless `terminal` is itself a real parent domain with meaningful sibling subdomains.
- Names should be short but purpose-revealing; do not make them cryptic.
- Short generic filenames such as `registry.ts`, `resolve.ts`, `adapter.ts`, or `types.ts` are acceptable only inside a narrow folder that supplies the missing domain context. At broad roots, use more specific names.
- Avoid vague files such as `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `manager.ts`, `misc.ts`, or `common.ts` unless the surrounding folder gives them a narrow, obvious meaning.
- Local one-off helpers should stay near their only use. Shared files should represent a real shared domain concept.
- Split by responsibility/domain boundary, not mechanically one function per file or one noun per folder.

## Renames, moves, and canonical paths

When introducing a new canonical path, finish the migration.

- Update all imports/callers in the same change.
- Do not leave old and new paths in parallel.
- Do not add compatibility shims for internal moves unless explicitly requested or required for a published external API.
- Use codemods/search-replace for broad moves, but verify the result with targeted grep and typecheck.
- Preserve canonical import style:
  - Keep `@/...` aliases in UI code.
  - Do not convert alias imports into fragile long relative imports.
  - Respect package-local aliases and package export boundaries.
- Update related barrels, package exports, tests, docs, mocks, and testkits when they reference the moved path.
- If full migration is genuinely blocked, stop and report `[blocked]` with the exact remaining callers and blocker.

## Path canonicalization

Do not hand-roll `~` or home-directory path handling. Use the owning helper for the layer you edit:

- UI absolute expansion: `apps/ui/sources/utils/path/pathUtils.ts#resolveAbsolutePath`
- UI display formatting: `apps/ui/sources/utils/sessions/formatPathRelativeToHome.ts`
- CLI env/path expansion: `apps/cli/src/utils/path/expandHomeDirPath.ts`
- CLI handoff normalization: `apps/cli/src/session/handoff/paths/sessionHandoffPathNormalization.ts`

When editing path behavior, treat Windows as first-class:

- accept both `~/...` and `~\\...`
- trim trailing `/` and `\\` at the home boundary
- normalize mixed separators when values are used for equality, dedupe, repo identity, or persistence keys
- guard against sibling-prefix collisions (`C:\\Users\\alice` must not match `C:\\Users\\alice2`)

## Provider and catalog architecture

Provider-specific behavior must live behind the canonical catalog/registry surfaces.

- Shared provider facts belong in `packages/agents/*`.
- CLI executable provider wiring belongs in `apps/cli/src/backends/catalog.ts` and `apps/cli/src/backends/<provider>/index.ts`.
- UI provider composition belongs in `apps/ui/sources/agents/registry/*` and `apps/ui/sources/agents/providers/<provider>/*`.
- Internal packages use `src/providers/<providerId>`; `backends/` is reserved for `apps/cli`.
- Protocol provider-specific executable logic/policy/defaults must live under `packages/protocol/src/providers/<providerId>/**` when protocol is the owning layer.
- Shared/core code must not branch on provider names when the behavior can be obtained through a catalog entry, adapter hook, or registry result.
- If a cross-provider feature needs provider-specific behavior, extend the canonical entry/hook shape and implement it in provider-owned modules.

The detailed provider architecture lives in `docs/agents-catalog.md`.

## Feature gating

Use the canonical feature system only. Do not add ad-hoc env checks, direct payload poking, or feature-specific inference logic.

- Feature ids/dependencies live in `packages/protocol/src/features/catalog.ts`.
- Feature decisions live in protocol decision helpers and package-local decision services.
- Server-represented gates are booleans under `features.<featureId path>.enabled`.
- `capabilities` may explain details/diagnostics but must not be used as a gate.
- Treat missing or malformed server enabled bits as disabled. Checks must be `readServerEnabledBit(payload, featureId) === true`.
- Enforce dependencies through `applyFeatureDependencies(...)`; do not duplicate dependency logic at call sites.
- Server route gating must use the central server feature gate helpers.

Details: `docs/feature-gating.md`.

## Encryption storage modes

Happier supports encrypted-at-rest and plaintext-at-rest session storage. This is a storage-mode choice, not a transport/authentication choice.

- Server storage policy: `required_e2ee | optional | plaintext_only`.
- Account/session encryption mode: `e2ee | plain`.
- Message/pending content envelope:
  - encrypted: `{ t: 'encrypted', c: string }`
  - plain: `{ t: 'plain', v: unknown }`
- Always enforce mode/content-kind compatibility at HTTP, socket, and pending write choke points.
- Never assume content is encrypted. Parse the envelope and branch explicitly.
- Plain sessions must not require `encryptedDataKey` for sharing; e2ee sharing/public-share must require a valid encrypted data-key envelope.
- Gate plaintext behavior only through canonical feature ids: `encryption.plaintextStorage`, `encryption.accountOptOut`.

Details: `docs/encryption.md`.

## Binary-safe runtime and internal packages

Happier ships binary installers. First-party runtime paths must work on machines without system `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bunx`.

- Do not directly spawn `node` or package managers in product runtime paths; use centralized managed runtime/tool abstractions.
- Before adding/changing provider install/update/runtime flows, classify the path as system-first backend CLI, managed-first prerequisite, managed package, vendor install recipe, or managed JS-runtime-dependent.
- Provider detection, install status, daemon validation, runtime spawning, and installables must share the same source of truth.
- Backend CLIs should prefer user/system installs by default unless an explicit source-preference setting says otherwise.
- Internal workspace dependencies must be declared by the package that imports them. Published hosts must bundle the internal workspace dependency closure.

Details: `docs/binary-runtime.md` and `docs/cli-architecture.md`.

## Package-specific instruction highlights

### UI (`apps/ui`)

- Use themed colors/tokens, app text primitives, translated strings, layout width constraints, and the app modal/popover systems.
- Do not introduce provider branching in generic UI/sync code; consume provider behavior through the UI registry.
- Follow `apps/ui/AGENTS.md` for UI structure, i18n, typography, settings, modal/popover, and workspace/worktree UX rules.

### CLI (`apps/cli`)

- Keep provider execution in `apps/cli/src/backends/<provider>/**` and shared runtime logic provider-agnostic.
- Preserve file logging/no-console-noise behavior for agent sessions.
- Follow `apps/cli/AGENTS.md` for CLI layout, daemon, backend catalog, binary-runtime, and packaging rules.

### Server (`apps/server`)

- Do not create Prisma migrations yourself.
- Use transactions and `afterTx` correctly; do not perform non-transactional side effects inside DB transactions.
- Validate inputs with Zod and keep retryable API operations idempotent.
- Follow `apps/server/AGENTS.md` for server-specific storage/action/privacy rules.

### Stack (`apps/stack`)

- Use `hstack` for stack/worktree/dev/test orchestration.
- Preserve stack-owned process isolation, ephemeral-port behavior, and multi-daemon expectations.
- Follow `apps/stack/AGENTS.md` for stack-specific command discipline and test lanes.

## Context7 and current docs

Use Context7 before implementing or validating work that touches configured post-training packages or when current library/framework/API behavior matters. If Context7 is unavailable, state that and use the best available official docs/source.

## Graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at `graphify-out/`.

- Before architecture/codebase relationship answers, read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` for corpus/community context.
- If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, navigate it before raw files.
- Prefer graphify queries/paths/explanations for cross-module relationship questions when graphify tooling is available.
- After modifying code files in a session, run `graphify update .` when a shell is available; if not available, report that it remains to do.

## Final handoff

Before finalizing:

- Verify every requested item is covered or marked `[blocked]`.
- Report tests/typechecks/docs checks actually run; do not fabricate evidence.
- Mention any validation you could not run and why.
- Ensure no unapproved `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_ANALYSIS.md`, or similar report files were created.

## Critical reminder

- Do not discard unrelated work.
- Behavior-changing code needs test-first validation.
- Mock only system boundaries, never internal logic.
- Use canonical catalogs/helpers instead of parallel implementations.
- Keep feature gates fail-closed, encryption envelopes explicit, and runtime paths binary-safe.
